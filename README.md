-  Book seats before the screening.
-  Buy tickets in advance.
-  Check the film schedule for the upcoming week.
-  Check our tickets.
-  Buy tickets without an account.
### Due to the introduced functionalities, the Cinema is able to:
-  Handle VIP and 3D screenings.
-  Collect all bookings and view them.
-  Display the repertoire available.
-  Add new movies to the film schedule.

#### Additional functionalities:
- Lombok* is added to get further functionalities in the future and for logging purposes for now (booking and buying tickets operation and adding new movies into film schedule to better understanding the processes).
###### *For now @Getter and @Setter annotation have not been included.
#### Future:
 -  Unit tests and the ability to operate the application on the fly by entering data in the console rather than in the main method will be added.
